A matrix calculator developed in Java. this repository is an archive of the files for Tugas Besar 1 IF2123 Aljabar Linear dan Geometri 2023/2024. The main goal of this project is to make a Java library that is able to solve Linear Algebra problems using several methods including matrices. These methods include Gauss Elimination, Gauss-Jordan Elimination, Inverse, and Cramer's Rule. Aside of that, this project also include several implementation of the library: Polinomial Interpolation, Bicubic Interpolation, and Double Linear Regression.
